title: Flattr'ing this
---
Since a few days, this blog features a Flattr link for anyone who is interested
in it.  Flattr is a micropayment platform and a great way to show your love and
appreciation to people that offer free online content.  I was tipped about this
one by a few readers, and have already received my first Flattrs.  I will put
the revenue I get out of this into other Flattr-aware blogs or open source
projects, to stimulate high-quality online content further.

This site features a "Flattr this" button, on the "icon sidebar" on the right,
right under the Twitter button.  The icon uses minimal space, but provides an
instant link to the Flattr thing for that article, or, in case I consider the
article too small to be Flattr'able, to the general blog's Flattr thing.  You
can see where this one links to for the current page by hovering your mouse
over it.
