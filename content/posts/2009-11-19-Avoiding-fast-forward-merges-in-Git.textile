Avoiding fast-forward merges in Git

Just a pointer to an excellent post I wanted to share with you:

In the section "Why we shouldnâ€™t fast-forward" at "http://robey.lag.net/2009/11/29/more-git.html":http://robey.lag.net/2009/11/29/more-git.html, Robey explains very clearly how fast forwards effectively make you loose historical information that may be crucial to ever reconstruct or understand your own project's history.
